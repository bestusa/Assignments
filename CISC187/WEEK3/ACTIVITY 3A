## Activity 3A Arrays

```C++
cout << "This is Activity 3A";
```



1. Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 4 N + 16 steps.


-In big O notation, an algorithm running at 4N +16 steps of work is 
expressed as O(N). 
-Which means the algorithm has linear growth. 
-We ignore the coefficients and constants in time complexity because in the long run 
(a huge amount of data) , the algorithm behaves like a degree 1 graph.

-For example, when an array is sorted using a 4N +16 step algorithm the projected 
amount of steps for an array of size 300 is 1,216 steps or about 1,200 steps. 
-Dividing these numbers gives a consistent rate of change that is linear




2.Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 2 N^2.

-The time complexity is O(n^2). 
-A great way to identify this sort of algorithm is when the 
function has nested loops.





3.Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the following function, which returns the 
sum of all numbers of an array after the numbers have been doubled

```
def double_then_sum(array) 
	doubled_array = []

	array.each do |number| 
		doubled_array << number *= 2
	end

	sum = 0

	doubled_array.each do |number| 
		sum += number
	end
	return sum 
end

```
-The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N) meaning it has a linear type of structure.
-The first do loop doubles the array and that happens only once (which equates to 1N steps)
-The second do loop iterates through the new double_array once as well which also takes steps.
-Therefore the total operations of this code is 2N steps, but is represented as O(N) using O(N) time complexity.




4.Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of the 
following function, which accepts an array of strings and prints each string in multiple cases:


```
def multiple_cases(array) 
	array.each do |string|
		puts string.upcase 
		puts string.downcase 
		puts string.capitalize
	end 
end
```



-This function performs a total of four steps linearly.
-one in the .each function
-three inside the loop performing .upcase, .downcase, .capitalize.
-So the operation equates to 3N and we represent that as O(N) in time complexity.



5.The next function iterates over an array of numbers, and for each number whose index is even, 
it prints the sum of that number plus every number in the array. What is this function’s efficiency 
in terms of Big O Notation?

```
def every_other(array) 
	array.each_with_index do |number, index|
		if index.even?
			array.each do |other_number|
            	puts number + other_number
			end 
		end
	end 
end
```

-This function runs approximately at ½ N^2 steps. In time complexity this function run at O(N^2) efficiency. 
-This is because the outer loop runs N time and the inner loop runs ½ N times. 
-This is because it has a conditional statement only skipping the odd integers and iterating to the even integers. The big differences with this function is that it has nested loops making the time complexity a quadric.
